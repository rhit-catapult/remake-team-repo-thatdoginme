PRIORITY LEVELS
==============

HIGH PRIORITY (Core Gameplay):
- Character sprite sheets (idle, walk, run, jump, fall)
- Basic attack animations
- Platform textures for both stages
- Core sound effects (jumps, attacks, landing)

MEDIUM PRIORITY (Polish):
- Background layers and parallax elements
- Attack effect visuals
- UI graphics and frames
- Stage music

LOW PRIORITY (Future Enhancements):
- Advanced particle effects
- Environmental animations
- Additional character expressions
- Menu transitions and effects

NOTES
=====
- All character sprites should be designed to work with the current 60x80 collision rectangle
- Platform textures should tile seamlessly for different platform sizes
- Sound effects should be normalized to consistent volume levels
- Background layers should be designed for parallax scrolling at different speeds
- All assets should maintain a consistent art style across the game

This list represents the complete visual and audio asset pipeline needed
to transform the current colored-rectangle prototype into a fully realized
fighting game experience.
