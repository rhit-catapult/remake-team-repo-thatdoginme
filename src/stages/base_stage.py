"""
Base Stage - Foundation for all battle arenas
==============================================

This module contains the base Stage class that all battle arenas inherit from.
Defines common properties like platforms, boundaries, and hazards.

TODO:
- Implement collision detection with platforms and boundaries
- Add dynamic camera system that follows action
- Create parallax background system
- Add stage hazards and interactive elements
- Implement ledge mechanics for recovery
- Add visual effects and atmosphere

Stage Components:
- Main platform (ground level)
- Additional platforms (for vertical gameplay)
- Blast zones (KO boundaries)
- Background layers (parallax scrolling)
- Stage hazards (optional)
- Spawn points for players
